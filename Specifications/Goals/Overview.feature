Feature: Overview
    Would you buy this?

	Trust your friends and network to give advice on whether they would buy an ethical product.

    Sustainable Development Goal 12 (SDG12) calls for responsible consumption and
    production patterns.

    Sub-goals 12.6 and 12.8 suggest we need to:
        * Ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development
        * Encourage companies to adopt sustainable practices

    Would you buy this aims to fulfil these goals by
        a) providing a source of information on what products are ethical
        b) empowering consumers to make ethical choices
        c) through purchasing power, encouraging companies to adopt sustainable practices
